# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Documentation
- Maintain clear and comprehensive README documentation, including updates for new features and changes.
- Follow specific documentation and README guidelines to ensure consistency across projects.

## 2. Error Handling
- Implement consistent error logging and propagation throughout the code.
- Catch errors, log them using console.error(), and re-throw when appropriate.

## 3. Security
- Use environment variables for sensitive information and configuration values instead of hardcoding them.
- Follow security and compliance best practices to protect the application and user data.

## 4. Code Structure
- Adhere to established code style guidelines for consistent and readable code.
- Follow Docker best practices for containerization and deployment.

## 5. Configuration Management
- Utilize environment variables and configuration files for managing application settings.
- Avoid hardcoding configuration values directly in files like docker-compose.yml.

## 6. Dependency Management
- Regularly update and maintain project dependencies.
- Use a consistent approach for managing and documenting dependencies.

## 7. Deployment
- Provide clear and detailed deployment instructions for setting up and running the application.

## 8. Version Control
- Use specific commit message formatting: Include a type (e.g., feat) in parentheses, followed by a colon and a brief description in the PR title.
