# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow the language-specific naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python).
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood.
- Use meaningful and pronounceable names that convey the purpose or behavior.

## 2. Code Structure
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Limit the number of parameters in functions (aim for 3 or fewer).
- Use consistent indentation and formatting throughout the codebase.
- Group related code together and separate unrelated code.
- Avoid deep nesting; extract complex conditions into separate functions.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to reduce code duplication.

## 3. Documentation
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the purpose of changes.
- Maintain up-to-date README files with project setup and usage instructions.
- Document public APIs, including parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- Use inline comments sparingly; focus on writing self-explanatory code.

## 4. Error Handling
- Use specific exception types and avoid catching generic exceptions.
- Provide informative error messages that help in debugging.
- Log errors with appropriate context for easier troubleshooting.
- Handle errors at the appropriate level of abstraction.
- Fail fast: detect and report errors as early as possible.

## 5. Performance
- Write efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Optimize critical paths and frequently executed code.
- Use appropriate caching mechanisms to improve response times.
- Minimize database queries and optimize them for performance.
- Profile the code to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## 6. Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Keep sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) out of the codebase.
- Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

## 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
- Implement integration tests for testing interactions between components.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical parts of the application.
- Write clear and descriptive test names that explain the test's purpose.
- Keep tests independent and avoid dependencies between test cases.

## 8. Version Control
- Make small, focused commits with clear commit messages.
- Use feature branches for developing new features or fixing bugs.
- Perform code reviews before merging changes into the main branch.
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable at all times.
- Use meaningful and consistent tags for releases.

## 9. Code Reusability
- Create modular and reusable components.
- Use design patterns appropriately to solve common problems.
- Favor composition over inheritance when designing class relationships.
- Create and use utility functions for common operations.
- Design flexible and extensible interfaces for better code reuse.

## 10. Maintainability
- Follow consistent coding standards across the project.
- Refactor code regularly to improve its structure and readability.
- Remove dead code and unused variables/functions.
- Keep dependencies up to date and minimize their number.
- Document architectural decisions and significant changes.
